## About the project

I tried using libraries I heard about but never got to use in a real project (SWR, material UI) to spice things up a bit.
There clearly is plenty of room to improve UI, UX and code quality, but time is up.

This was developed on node v14.15.4 and npm v7.9.0

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
